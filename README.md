# CrossSell_Competition
It was my results from a competition I participated in Kaggle about Binary Classification. 
This competition was the "Binary Classification of Insurance Cross Selling
Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 7".
I used Light GBM on Python on a Azure Machine Learning Studio Machine.
